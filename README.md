## TODO
1. `geopandas`
2. `geoplot` 
3. `altair`
4. `bokeh`
5. `plotly`
6. `folium`
7. `leaflet`
8. `osmnx`
9. `keplergl`
10. `arcgis`


## AHH
Cut down the examples to only one quick run through the geoplot and geopandas example and then move on to the way that same map would look using other libraries. 

Add links to NHGIS (ipums) etc etc.
